# 3D Cube Stories - Bug Fixes Summary

## 🐛 Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Horizontal Swipe Direction Issue**
**Problem**: The swipe direction was reversed - swiping left was going to previous story instead of next story.

**Root Cause**: The navigation logic was incorrect in the `handleDragEnd` function.

**Fix Applied**:
```javascript
// BEFORE (incorrect):
if (deltaX > 0 && activeStoryIndex > 0) {
  newIndex = activeStoryIndex - 1; // Wrong: swipe right went to previous
} else if (deltaX < 0 && activeStoryIndex < stories.length - 1) {
  newIndex = activeStoryIndex + 1; // Wrong: swipe left went to next
}

// AFTER (correct):
if (deltaX < 0 && activeStoryIndex < stories.length - 1) {
  newIndex = activeStoryIndex + 1; // Correct: swipe LEFT goes to NEXT story
} else if (deltaX > 0 && activeStoryIndex > 0) {
  newIndex = activeStoryIndex - 1; // Correct: swipe RIGHT goes to PREVIOUS story
}
```

### 2. **Real-time Drag Rotation Direction**
**Problem**: During drag, the cube was rotating in the opposite direction to the finger movement.

**Root Cause**: The rotation calculation was using subtraction instead of addition.

**Fix Applied**:
```javascript
// BEFORE (incorrect):
const newRotation = cubeRotation - rotationDelta;

// AFTER (correct):
const newRotation = cubeRotation + rotationDelta;
```

**Logic**: 
- Drag right (positive X) → cube rotates right (positive rotation)
- Drag left (negative X) → cube rotates left (negative rotation)

### 3. **Improved Threshold and Snapping**
**Problem**: The navigation threshold was too high (30%) and snapping wasn't always working properly.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Reduced threshold from 30% to 25% of screen width for better UX
- Added proper `rotationY.set(targetRotation)` to ensure motion value syncs with animation
- Enhanced snapping logic to work whether navigation occurs or not

```javascript
// Improved threshold
const threshold = viewportWidth * 0.25; // Reduced from 0.3

// Better snapping
rotationY.set(targetRotation); // Sync motion value with target
```

### 4. **Enhanced Debug Information**
**Problem**: Debug information wasn't clear about expected swipe directions.

**Fix Applied**:
```javascript
// BEFORE:
"Swipe horizontally for 3D cube navigation | Swipe down to dismiss"

// AFTER:
"Swipe LEFT for next story | Swipe RIGHT for previous | Swipe DOWN to dismiss"

// Added threshold indicator:
"Threshold: 25% of screen width | Current rotation: {Math.round(cubeRotation)}°"
```

### 5. **Keyboard Navigation Sync**
**Problem**: Keyboard navigation wasn't updating the motion value, causing potential desync.

**Fix Applied**:
```javascript
// Added rotationY.set() to keyboard handlers
cubeControls.start({...});
rotationY.set(targetRotation); // Ensures motion value stays in sync
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior Now

### Touch/Swipe Navigation:
- **Swipe LEFT** (finger moves left): Navigate to NEXT story
- **Swipe RIGHT** (finger moves right): Navigate to PREVIOUS story  
- **Swipe DOWN** (finger moves down): Dismiss story viewer
- **Real-time feedback**: Cube follows finger movement naturally during drag

### Keyboard Navigation:
- **Arrow Left** (←): Navigate to previous story
- **Arrow Right** (→): Navigate to next story
- **Escape**: Close story viewer

### Threshold Behavior:
- **25% threshold**: Swipe must exceed 25% of screen width to trigger navigation
- **Velocity override**: Fast swipes (>500px/s) can trigger navigation even below threshold
- **Snap back**: If threshold not met, cube smoothly returns to current story position

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Cube Face Layout:
```
Previous Story (Left Face):   rotateY(-90deg) translateZ(50vw)
Current Story (Front Face):   rotateY(0deg) translateZ(50vw)  
Next Story (Right Face):      rotateY(90deg) translateZ(50vw)
```

### Rotation Logic:
- Story 0: `rotation = 0°` (front face visible)
- Story 1: `rotation = -90°` (rotate left to show next story)
- Story 2: `rotation = -180°` (rotate further left)
- Each story: `rotation = -index * 90°`

### Motion Value Synchronization:
The `rotationY` motion value now stays properly synchronized with the cube animation state, preventing visual glitches and ensuring smooth transitions.

## ✅ Testing Checklist

To verify the fixes work correctly:

1. **Swipe Left**: Should go to next story with smooth cube rotation
2. **Swipe Right**: Should go to previous story with smooth cube rotation  
3. **Partial Swipe**: Should snap back to current story if threshold not met
4. **Fast Flick**: Should navigate even with small distance if velocity is high
5. **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys should work and stay in sync
6. **Edge Cases**: Should not navigate beyond first/last story
7. **Real-time Feedback**: Cube should follow finger naturally during drag
