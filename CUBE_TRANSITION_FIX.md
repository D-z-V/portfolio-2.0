# 3D Cube Stories - Transition Mounting Fix

## 🐛 Issue Description

During horizontal touch navigation between stories in the 3D cube, the wrong story component was being momentarily mounted on a cube face during transitions. For example:

- **Sequence**: React → Node → MongoDB
- **Issue**: When swiping from React → Node, the MongoDB component would briefly flash on the cube face before showing Node
- **Same issue**: Occurred in reverse direction (Node → React would briefly show MongoDB)

This created a jarring visual experience and broke the smooth transition effect.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by several timing and state management problems:

### 1. **Immediate Index Changes**
The `activeStoryIndex` was being updated immediately when drag ended, causing the `getVisibleStories()` function to recalculate which stories to render while the cube was still transitioning.

### 2. **Dynamic Face Calculation**
The visible stories were being calculated dynamically based on the current `activeStoryIndex`, which meant that during transitions, the faces would change before the animation completed.

### 3. **No Story Preloading**
Stories weren't being preloaded, so when the index changed, React had to mount new components on the fly, causing the wrong story to briefly appear.

### 4. **Race Conditions**
The CSS transition and React state updates were happening at different speeds, creating race conditions where the wrong story would be rendered on the wrong face.

## ✅ Comprehensive Fix Applied

### 1. **Separated Display and Active Indices**
```javascript
const [activeStoryIndex, setActiveStoryIndex] = useState(0);
const [displayStoryIndex, setDisplayStoryIndex] = useState(0); // Index used for rendering faces
```

- `activeStoryIndex`: Controls which story is "active" (playing)
- `displayStoryIndex`: Controls which stories are rendered on cube faces
- During transitions, faces use `displayStoryIndex` for stability

### 2. **Story Preloading System**
```javascript
const [preloadedStories, setPreloadedStories] = useState(new Set([0]));

const preloadAdjacentStories = useCallback((centerIndex) => {
  const toPreload = new Set(preloadedStories);
  toPreload.add(centerIndex); // Current story
  if (centerIndex > 0) toPreload.add(centerIndex - 1); // Previous
  if (centerIndex < stories.length - 1) toPreload.add(centerIndex + 1); // Next
  setPreloadedStories(toPreload);
}, [preloadedStories]);
```

### 3. **Delayed Index Updates**
```javascript
// Only update active story index AFTER the transition starts
if (newIndex !== activeStoryIndex) {
  // Preload the new story and adjacent ones before changing index
  preloadAdjacentStories(newIndex);
  
  // Small delay to ensure preloading starts before index change
  setTimeout(() => {
    setActiveStoryIndex(newIndex);
  }, 50);
}
```

### 4. **Stable Face Management**
```javascript
const getVisibleStories = useCallback(() => {
  const visibleStories = [];
  const baseIndex = isTransitioning ? displayStoryIndex : activeStoryIndex;
  // ... rest of function uses baseIndex for stability
}, [activeStoryIndex, displayStoryIndex, isTransitioning, preloadedStories]);
```

### 5. **Proper Transition End Handling**
```javascript
const handleTransitionEnd = useCallback(() => {
  if (isTransitioning) {
    // Update display index to match active index after transition completes
    setDisplayStoryIndex(activeStoryIndex);
    // ... reset transition state
  }
}, [isTransitioning, activeStoryIndex]);
```

### 6. **Enhanced Story Rendering Logic**
```javascript
// Determine if this story should be active
const isActive = index === activeStoryIndex;
const shouldRender = isPreloaded || isActive || position === 'front';

// Only render story component if preloaded or active
{shouldRender ? (
  <StoriesLazy
    key={`story-${index}`}
    stories={[story]}
    isPaused={!isActive}
  />
) : (
  // Placeholder for non-preloaded stories
  <div>Story {index + 1}</div>
)}
```

## 🎯 How the Fix Works

### During Transition:
1. **User starts drag**: Stories are preloaded based on potential navigation
2. **Drag ends**: Transition animation starts, but `activeStoryIndex` stays unchanged initially
3. **50ms delay**: `activeStoryIndex` updates after preloading completes
4. **Transition continues**: Cube faces remain stable using `displayStoryIndex`
5. **Transition ends**: `displayStoryIndex` updates to match `activeStoryIndex`

### Key Benefits:
- **No Wrong Story Flashes**: Stories are preloaded before being needed
- **Stable Face Rendering**: Faces don't change during transitions
- **Smooth Animations**: No interruptions from component mounting/unmounting
- **Proper Timing**: State updates are coordinated with CSS transitions

## 🚀 Result

The 3D cube story navigation now provides:

✅ **Smooth transitions** with no wrong story flashes  
✅ **Proper preloading** of adjacent stories  
✅ **Stable face management** during animations  
✅ **Coordinated state updates** with CSS transitions  
✅ **Consistent behavior** across touch and keyboard navigation  

The user experience now matches the intended smooth Instagram-style story navigation without any visual glitches or wrong component mounting during transitions.
