# 3D Cube Stories - Final Rotation Direction Fix

## üêõ Issue Identified

The cube rotation was happening in the opposite direction:
- **Left swipe** was moving cube to the RIGHT
- **Right swipe** was moving cube to the LEFT

This made the interaction feel unnatural and opposite to user expectations.

## üîß Root Cause

The problem was in the real-time drag rotation calculation. I was using negative mapping (`-dragProgress * 90`) which inverted the rotation direction, making the cube rotate opposite to the finger movement.

## ‚úÖ Final Fix Applied

### 1. **Corrected Real-time Drag Rotation**

```javascript
// BEFORE (incorrect - cube moved opposite to finger):
const rotationDelta = -dragProgress * 90; // Reversed mapping

// AFTER (correct - cube follows finger naturally):
const rotationDelta = dragProgress * 90; // Direct mapping - cube follows finger
```

**Result**: Now when you swipe LEFT, the cube rotates LEFT. When you swipe RIGHT, the cube rotates RIGHT.

### 2. **Fixed Swipe Direction Logic**

```javascript
// FINAL CORRECT LOGIC:
// Swipe LEFT (deltaX < 0) = cube rotates left = reveals NEXT story (from right face)
// Swipe RIGHT (deltaX > 0) = cube rotates right = reveals PREVIOUS story (from left face)
if (deltaX < 0 && activeStoryIndex < stories.length - 1) {
  newIndex = activeStoryIndex + 1; // Next story
} else if (deltaX > 0 && activeStoryIndex > 0) {
  newIndex = activeStoryIndex - 1; // Previous story
}
```

### 3. **Updated Debug Instructions**

```javascript
// Updated to reflect correct behavior:
"FIXED: Swipe LEFT for next story | Swipe RIGHT for previous | Swipe DOWN to dismiss"
```

## üéØ Final Behavior

### Natural Cube Movement:
- **Swipe LEFT** ‚Üí Cube rotates LEFT ‚Üí Reveals NEXT story
- **Swipe RIGHT** ‚Üí Cube rotates RIGHT ‚Üí Reveals PREVIOUS story
- **Swipe DOWN** ‚Üí Dismisses story viewer

### Technical Logic:
- **Cube Face Layout**:
  - Previous story: LEFT face (-90¬∞)
  - Current story: FRONT face (0¬∞)
  - Next story: RIGHT face (90¬∞)

- **Rotation Logic**:
  - Swipe LEFT: cube rotates left (negative), bringing RIGHT face (next story) to front
  - Swipe RIGHT: cube rotates right (positive), bringing LEFT face (previous story) to front

## üöÄ Ready to Test

The component should now feel completely natural:

1. **Real-time feedback**: Cube follows your finger movement exactly
2. **Correct navigation**: Swipe directions match Instagram expectations
3. **Smooth snapping**: Cube snaps to proper positions after swipe
4. **Debug info**: Shows live rotation values for verification

### Test at `/stories-demo`:
1. Toggle "3D Cube Mode" ON
2. Open any story
3. Swipe LEFT to go to next story (cube should rotate left)
4. Swipe RIGHT to go to previous story (cube should rotate right)
5. Watch the debug info to see the rotation values

The cube movement should now feel intuitive and match your finger movements perfectly! üéâ
